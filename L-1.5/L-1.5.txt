L-1.5: Process States in Operating System| Schedulers(Long term,Short term,Medium term)
Process states refer to the various stages through which a process passes from creation to termination.
The primary states of a process include: New, Ready, Running, Terminated, and Wait/Block.
The New state refers to the initial stage where the process is created but has not yet been loaded into the memory.
The Ready state is where the process is loaded into the memory and is waiting for CPU time to execute.
The Long Term Scheduler is responsible for bringing processes from the New state to the Ready state.
The Running state is where the process is actively being executed by the CPU.
The process is given a new address in the memory, where the CPU executes the instructions.
The number of processes that can be in the Running state simultaneously depends on the number of CPUs available.
The Terminated state is where the process has completed its execution and is removed from the memory.
The Wait/Block state is where the process is waiting for an event such as an I/O operation to complete before it can continue.
The process can move between these states as it executes, and the operating system manages the transitions.
The process life cycle includes primary states, such as the running state, ready state, and wait/block state.
The wait/block state occurs when a process requests an I/O operation and the CPU asks it to wait aside and complete the operation in the future.
Additional states may exist, such as the suspend wait state when the wait/block queue is full and the medium turn scheduler sends a process to secondary memory temporarily.
The suspend ready state occurs when the ready queue is full, and a process is put on hold until there is space in the queue again.
The backing store is a term used when a process needs to be sent back to secondary memory before it can move to the ready state.
The medium turn scheduler is responsible for handling processes that need to be sent to secondary memory temporarily due to various reasons, including filling of the ready queue.
