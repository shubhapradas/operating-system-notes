
Switching between user mode and kernel mode is a fundamental concept in computer operating systems. User mode is the mode in which user-level processes execute,
 while kernel mode is the mode in which the operating system's kernel executes.

When a user-level process needs to access the hardware or perform privileged operations (such as creating a new process), it must request the kernel's help. 
The process switches from user mode to kernel mode to make the request, and the kernel performs the requested operation on behalf of the process.
 After the operation is completed, the process switches back to user mode.

By switching between user mode and kernel mode, the operating system can prevent user-level processes from accessing hardware or performing privileged operations 
directly, which could cause system instability or security issues. The kernel acts as a gatekeeper, controlling access to system resources and ensuring that 
user-level processes are only able to perform authorized actions.

The video emphasizes the importance of switching between user mode and kernel mode to prevent problems because if user-level processes 
were able to directly access the hardware or perform privileged operations, it would be easier for malicious software to take advantage of those 
capabilities and compromise the system. Switching between user mode and kernel mode is a crucial security feature that helps to protect the system from 
unauthorized access and misuse.

The video compares the user mode to being a user at a bank, where the user cannot directly access the hardware or control the resources. 
The kernel mode is compared to the bank clerk or PO, who can access the hardware and control the resources.
 The operating system's responsibility is to manage and govern the resources.
The concept of user mode and kernel mode is an essential part of operating systems. 

In user mode, users can run applications and perform tasks using their laptops or computers. 
On the other hand, all the core functionalities of the operating system, major drivers, and hardware components work in the kernel mode.

To illustrate this concept with a simple example, consider using a Linux operating system and opening a text editor to write a C program that involves 
reading and writing data to a file. As the file is stored in the hard disk, a hardware component, the kernel must be involved as users cannot access
 the hardware directly.

To access the hardware through the kernel, system calls are used. In the case of reading data from a file, the system call used is the "read" system call. 
When this system call is executed, the system moves from user mode to kernel mode. This transition is signaled by an interrupt or a trap, 
and the mode bit changes from 1 to 0.

In kernel mode, the system call is executed, which involves reading the data from the hard disk. After reading the data, 
the write system call is used to write the updated value back to the file. Once the process is complete, 
the system transitions back from kernel mode to user mode, and the mode bit changes from 0 to 1.

The user mode and kernel mode can be compared to the experience of withdrawing money from a bank. Users are in the user mode, 
and the bank clerks are in the kernel mode. Users cannot directly access the hardware (money) but must fill out a form and hand it to 
the clerks through the window. The clerks then process the request (system call) and hand over the money (updated value) to the user.
 The user then leaves the bank, and the process is complete.

The concept of user mode and kernel mode is essential as it prevents users from accessing the hardware directly, 
which could cause significant problems. The operating system is responsible for managing and governing the resources, 
and the dual-mode system allows for the seamless execution of user applications while also ensuring the proper functioning of the operating system.

Overall, understanding the concept of user mode and kernel mode is critical for anyone studying or working with operating systems. 
It is a theoretical topic, but it is essential to know for competitive exams and understanding the fundamental concepts of operating systems.
